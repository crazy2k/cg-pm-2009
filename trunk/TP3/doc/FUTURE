Unlike trunk/TP1, trunk/TP3 is a little more organized (at least, it's not the
mixture of two "TPs" ("Trabajos Prácticos", something like a "special
assignment" in English).

I'd dare to say the code in here is somewhat more polished too, since more
time has been devoted to it. Oh! And all the comments in the code are (or
should be) in English.

However, bear in mind that this code was written as a "special assignment" for
a subject ("Computación Gráfica", or Computer Graphics in English) of the
Computer Science Department of the University of Buenos Aires, with all that
that means:

    * Development time was limited: The assignment had to be completed in less
      than two months.
    * We learned as we made: This may justify some of our naive errors (not
      all, of course)
    * The main objective was learning: Although we tried to write good code
      (readable, robust, extensible), that wasn't one of our main objectives.

Beyond all this, I wouldn't mind maintaining this code and/or discussing
improvements for it.
